PredictionIO is a prediction server for building smart applications. You can make
predictions through PredictionIO just as you would filter data using a database server.

With PredictionIO, you can write apps
* that predict user behaviors based on solid data science
* using your choice of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms
* without worrying about scalability

Detailed documentation is available on our
[documentation site](http://docs.prediction.io).
